## Celebrating 30 years of NESS
The 31st New England Statistics Symposium (NESS) will be hosted by the
Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut, on April
21--22, 2017. We will be celebrating the 30th anniversary since the
NESS was started at UConn in 1987! The mission of NESS is to bring
together statisticians from all over New England and beyond to a
central location to share research, discuss emerging issues in the
field, and network with colleagues.

The symposium will feature three [short courses](short-courses), two
invited [plenary talks](keynote-speakers), invited paper sessions, and
posters. There will a student paper competition and a student poster
competition sponsored by our industrial partners.
