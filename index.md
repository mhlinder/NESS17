The theme of the conference is to promote and support the development,
application and appropriate use of statistical methods for lifetime or
time-to-event data in data science, precision medicine and risk
analysis. The focus of research includes i) Analysis of time-to-event
data with censoring, truncation and competing risks, ii) Counting
processes, multi-state, multiple or clustered events, and longitudinal
biomarker histories, and quality-of-life models, iii)
Interdisciplinary research in areas such as finance, economics,
imaging, engineering, genomics and genetics. The conference is
sponsored by the Lifetime Data Analysis Interest Group (LIDA IG),
which operates under the rules of the Committee on Sections of the
American Statistical Association (ASA). The Interest Group aims
eventually to be approved as a Section of the ASA.
