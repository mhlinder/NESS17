<p><strong><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~madigan/">Dr. David Madigan</a></strong>, Columbia University<br /> “Honest learning for the healthcare system: large-scale evidence from real-world data”<br /> <small>(joint work with Martijn J. Schuemie, Patrick B. Ryan, George Hripcsak, and Marc A. Suchard)</small></p>
<p>In practice, our learning healthcare system relies primarily on observational studies generating one effect estimate at a time using customized study designs with unknown operating characteristics and publishing – or not – one estimate at a time. When we investigate the distribution of estimates that this process has produced, we see clear evidence of its shortcomings, including an over-abundance of estimates where the confidence interval does not include one (i.e. statistically significant effects) and strong indicators of publication bias. In essence, published observational research represents unabashed data fishing. We propose a standardized process for performing observational research that can be evaluated, calibrated and applied at scale to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base than previously possible, fostering a truly learning healthcare system. We demonstrate this new paradigm by generating evidence about all pairwise comparisons of treatments for depression for a relevant set of health outcomes using four large US insurance claims databases. In total, we estimate 17,718 hazard ratios, each using a comparative effectiveness study design and propensity score stratification on par with current state-of-the-art, albeit one-off, observational studies. Moreover, the process enables us to employ negative and positive controls to evaluate and calibrate estimates ensuring, for example, that the 95% confidence interval includes the true effect size approximately 95% of time. The result set consistently reflects current established knowledge where known, and its distribution shows no evidence of the faults of the current process. Doctors, regulators, and other medical decision makers can potentially improve patient-care by making well-informed decisions based on this evidence, and every treatment a patient receives becomes the basis for further evidence.</p>

He previously served as Chair of the Department of Statistics at Columbia University (2008-2013), Dean, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Rutgers University (2005-2007), Director, Institute of Biostatistics, Rutgers University (2003-2004), and Professor, Department of Statistics, Rutgers University (2001-2007). He received his bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Sciences (1984, First Class Honours, Gold Medal) and a Ph.D. in Statistics (1990), both from Trinity College Dublin.</p>
<p>Dr. Madigan has over 160 publications in such areas as Bayesian statistics, text mining, Monte Carlo methods, pharmacovigilance and probabilistic graphical models. In recent years he has focused on statistical methodology for generating reliable evidence from large-scale healthcare data. From 2011 to 2014 he was a member of the FDA’s Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Dr. Madigan is a fellow of the American Association of the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and the American Statistical Association (ASA), and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI). He served as Editor-in-Chief of Statistical Science (2008–2010) and Statistical Analysis and Data Mining, the ASA Data Science Journal (2013–2015).</p>
