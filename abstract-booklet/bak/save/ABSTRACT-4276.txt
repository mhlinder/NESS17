Inverse regressions constitute a class of sufficient dimension reduction methods targeting at estimating the central space by regression-type approaches implemented inversely on the predictors and the responses. The most representative approach in this family is the seminal Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) approach proposed by Li (1991). In this study, we first show that missing responses generally affect the validity of the inverse regressions under the scheme of the so-called missing at random, in the sense that the resulting estimations for the central space can be biased if data with missing responses are simply ignored.  We then propose two simple and effective adjustments for missing responses that guarantees the validity of the inverse regressions. The proposed methods share the essence and simplicity of the inverse regressions. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed inverse regressions for dealing with missing responses by numerical and theoretical analyses.
