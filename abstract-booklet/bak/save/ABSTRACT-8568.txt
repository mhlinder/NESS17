The FDA draft guidance on multiple endpoints in clinical trials (January 2017) pointed out the regulatory concern of the type II error rate inflation with multiple endpoints. Many of the statistical adjustment to control the type I error rate for multiplicity decrease the study power because they lowered the alpha level used for each of the individual endpoint. The use of co-primary endpoints does not require multiplicity adjustment for type I error but will also increase the type II error rate and decrease study power. In this presentation, I provide a few detailed steps on how to evaluate sample size based on the objective of the clinical study and the selected multiplicity adjustment to control type I error. Analytic forms of power for individual endpoint hypothesis can be derived for most commonly seen scenarios. Simulation can be also easily set up. Optimal sample size is possible by fine tune the individual power for each endpoint with different effect size assumptions.
