Type 2 diabetes (T2D) presents challenges both for physicians, who often have limited time and resources, and for patients, who can experience psychological and behavioural issues. Effective communication between physicians and patients, especially during the early phases of T2D treatment, may lead to improvements in patient self-care and outcomes, which is important considering the clinical benefits associated with achieving good glycaemic control early in the course of T2D.

IntroDia™ – a large cross-national survey in 26 countries – has investigated physician-patient communication during early T2D treatment. The survey was designed in partnership with the International Diabetes Federation and a multidisciplinary advisory board. Around 17,000 participants (physicians and patients with T2D) were surveyed using validated scales and novel questionnaires; these assessed physician-patient communication both at diagnosis and at first prescription of additional oral medication, as well as patient-reported outcomes. 

Overall, findings from IntroDia™ suggest that patient-physician communication at diagnosis of T2D and at add-on may be enhanced by physicians using more collaborative and encouraging – and fewer discouraging – conversation elements, and this may contribute to patients subsequently experiencing greater well-being and managing the disease more effectively.

Methodologies and results from the survey will be highlighted.
