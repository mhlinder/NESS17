The Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot is a visual and statistical technique to explore patterns of treatment effects across values of a continuously measured covariate such as a biomarker measurement. Originally developed specifically for investigation of survival outcomes, it has been extended to continuous, binary and count outcomes.  This talk will focus on the development of this extension â€“ what are the outcomes, the permutation statistics and the Type 1 error, the power of the test, comparison with other methods, and the software.  Then, a motivating example of how it is applied to analyze data from the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study will be presented. 
A quick summary of recent research development in STEPP will be presented at the end.
