In many applications where both predictors and responses are collected across geographical regions over time, the impact of the predictors to responses are often not static but time-varying. Moreover, the time-varying impact of the predictors may vary across different regions. To identify nearby regions where these time-varying impact behave similarly, we propose a spatially fused time-varying lattice model. We model time-varying impact of spatio-temporal predictors via a spatial lattice model with time-varying coefficients. Furthermore, we utilize fusion penalty to allow nearby regions to share same time-varying coefficients. The model parameters can be efficiently estimated via ADMM algorithm. One motivation application of our method is to identify agriculture management zones where the time-varying impact of environment attributes (e.g., growing degree days, heat stress,precipitation) on the crop yield is similar. Once these zones are identified, same planting policy could be implemented within these zones.
