An introductory overview of nonclinical statistics critical role in the drug development process will be reinforced by real world examples.  Discussion of issues in non-linear models for in vitro assays combined with examples of in vivo experimental designs and analysis will be used to highlight the impact statisticians make in early drug development.  We will discuss statistical methods and training needed for successful statistical contribution in the preclinical space.  We will also review the expectations of preclinical scientific collaborations and best practices in contrast with the role of clinical statisticians in drug development.
