Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease incidence are important for public health decision makers planning resource allocation and interventions designed to prevent or reduce disease transmission. Ensemble prediction methods, which combine predictions from multiple ``component" models, have recorded superior performance in a variety of tasks from weather prediction to product recommendation; however, applications of ensemble methods in the context of predicting infectious disease have been limited. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from several component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with multiple observed features such as recent observations of disease incidence and the time of the year when predictions are made. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable infectious disease predictions to public health decision makers.
