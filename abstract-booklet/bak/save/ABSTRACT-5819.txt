Design and analysis of cluster randomized trials must take into account correlation among outcomes from the same clusters. When applying standard generalized estimating equations (GEE), the first-order (e.g. treatment) effects can be estimated consistently even with a misspecified correlation structure. In settings for which the correlation is of interest, one could estimate this quantity via second-order generalized estimating equations (GEE2). We build upon GEE2 in the setting of missing data, for which we incorporate a "second-order" inverse-probability weighting (IPW) scheme and "second-order" double robustness (DR) equations that guard against model misspecification. We highlight the need to model correlation among missingness indicators in such settings. In addition, the computational difficulties in solving these second-order equations have motivated our development of stochastic algorithms for solving GEE2s, which alleviates the reliance on starting points and provides substantially faster convergence and a higher convergence rate than deterministic root-solving methods.
