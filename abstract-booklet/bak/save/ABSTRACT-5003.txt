Regression analysis is one of the most applied statistical techniques. The statistical inference of a linear regression model with a monotone constraint had been discussed in early analysis. A natural question arises when it comes to the difference between the cases of with and without the constraint. Although the comparison between confidence intervals of linear regression models with and without restriction for one predictor variable had been considered, this discussion for multiple regression is required.
We discuss the comparison of the intervals between a multiple linear regression model with and without constraints.
