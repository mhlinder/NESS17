Genomics signatures have enormous applications and impacts in medicine and drug development, such as disease diagnosis, disease prognosis, prediction of drug treatment response, and patient enrichment/stratification in clinical trial setting. The signatures are generally generated in early clinical development stage (phase I/II trials) and then validated in late clinical development stage (phase III).  However, the development of reliable genomics signatures is challenging, especially in early clinical development stage, as it frequently involves high-dimensional data with smaller sample size (small n large p). Two major issues statisticians face are (i) which variable selection method to use? (ii) how likely the signature can be replicated in late stage? In this presentation we will share our experience and perspectives on building reliable genomics signatures, and a Bayesian framework to estimate the probability of success for the proposed genomics signatures.
