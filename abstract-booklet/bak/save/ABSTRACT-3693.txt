Drug development is a lengthy process. Speeding up the drug development is a win-win for both patients and pharma companies. Thanks to the advancing technologies that generate data of new modalities with much richer information, the ‘Big Data’ has seen its adaption into drug development in the past 3-5 years. While ‘Big Data’ holds the promise to make drug development more efficient, its characteristics of high ‘volume’, ‘velocity’ and ‘variety’ present unique challenges to existing analytical infrastructures. In this talk I will use real examples to demonstrate how we use statistical innovations within Takeda to maximize the potential of Big Data and shorten the drug development.
