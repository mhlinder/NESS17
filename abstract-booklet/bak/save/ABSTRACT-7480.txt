There are (at least) two prominent paradigms to the modeling of networks, which might be called the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one describes a model that specifies the likelihood of observing a given network, i.e., these are probabilistic models of data that happen to arrive in the shape of a network. In the mechanistic approach, one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules, based on scientific understanding of the problem, that are used to grow or evolve the network over time. Both modeling approaches provide distinct angles and advantages to our understanding of complex systems. I propose to discuss two interrelated topics. First, I will present a framework to identify the essential network properties associated with mechanistic network models. The joint distribution of these properties determines whether it is feasible to model the given networks using a specific statistical framework. Second, I will discuss a general framework for both parameter inference and model selection for mechanistic network models. In the former, a mechanistic network model might incorporate some parameter whose value is not fixed and must therefore be learned from data. In the related problem of model selection, the goal is to learn our degree of belief that any of the candidate mechanistic models was used to generate the network. The proposed approach can quantify the probability that any given model in the collection generated the data, and this approach can therefore be used to select the most likely model from among the collection of candidate models.
