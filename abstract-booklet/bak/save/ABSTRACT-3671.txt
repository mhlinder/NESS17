In many real-world problems, the collected outcomes are of mixed types, including continuous measurements, binary indicators and counts, and the data may also subject to substantial missing values.Â Regardless of their types, these mixed outcomes are often interrelated, representing diverse reflections or views of the same underlying data generation mechanism. In particular, these correlated outcomes could be linked through sharing the same population heterogeneity. We develop a regularized finite mixture model that 1) finds sample clusters and jointly models incomplete mixed-type responses, 2) achieves shared predictor selection between responses and cluster components, and 3) detects and accommodates outliers. We provide oracle performance bounds for our model under a high-dimensional non-asymptotic framework. Owing to its integrative learning scheme, our model is particularly effective for the imputation of incomplete outcomes. Simulations and data examples show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
