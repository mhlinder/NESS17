One of the most contentious and pressing environmental issues today facing oil-producing states in the central US is the interaction of fracking activity with earthquake frequency. Exploratory analysis of fracking and earthquake data collected in Oklahoma from 2011 to 2015 suggest that gas extraction is closely associated with seismically active fault lines. In this analysis, generalized linear models are used with two main objectives. The first object is to model the number of earthquakes as a function of monthly fracking wastewater injection volume and location; second, to investigate the potential link between earthquake magnitude and injection volumes, while controlling for location within the state. Inference is carried out within the Bayesian framework using MCMC algorithms. One of the main challenges of this analysis is harmonizing several data sources recorded at different spatial scales. The results of this work aim to provide a deeper understanding of how induced earthquakes are related to wastewater injection volumes and assist in improved spatial planning of fracking activity in order to strike a balance between Oklahoma's energy industry and the protection of its community and infrastructure.
