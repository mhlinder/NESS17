Speculative bubble phenomena may result in explosive trends followed by
a sharp decline in financial time series. A bubble is formed when investorsâ€™
future profits expectations influence the present market value of securities.
Mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes are able to better model
such behavior in comparison to traditional ARIMA models. In this work we
propose Markov switching mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes
(MSMAR) to account for changes in regime at different times. Parameter
estimation is conducted in a Bayesian framework via MCMC algorithms. The
model is tested for performance with a simulation study and then applied to
Bitcoin/USD exchange rate and US inflation data.
