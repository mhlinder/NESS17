Geographic patterns in stroke mortality have been studied as far back as the 1960s, when a region of the southeastern United States became known as the "stroke belt" due to its unusually high rates. While stroke mortality rates are known to increase exponentially with age, an investigation of spatiotemporal trends by age group at the county-level is daunting due to the preponderance of small population sizes and/or few stroke events by age group. Our goal here is two-pronged.  First and foremost, we harness the power of a complex, nonseparable multivariate space-time model which borrows strength across space, time, and age group to obtain reliable estimates of yearly county-level mortality rates from US counties between 1973 and 2013 for those aged 65+. Second, we outline how the results of this model fit can be used to generate high-quality synthetic data for public use that preserve data confidentiality without sacrificing data utility.
