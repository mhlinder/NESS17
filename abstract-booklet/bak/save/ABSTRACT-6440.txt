Complex traits include a wide range of phenotypes from common diseases to physiological characteristics and their predisposition is generally related to the contribution of hundreds to thousands of variants with small effect. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach to detect these small-effect loci, providing an unbiased information to dissect the key biological mechanisms of complex traits. However, to be informative, GWAS require massive cohorts and many genomic consortia, including hundred investigators, are continuing to pool together samples to increase GWAS sample size and consequently their statistical power. There is a pervasive genetic correlation among complex traits due to causal relationships and shared molecular mechanisms. Thus, GWAS results can be used to conduct follow-up investigations, such as polygenic risk score analysis, Mendelian randomization, and phenome-wide association studies, to dissect the genetic architecture of additional traits. Different analytic approaches can be used to conduct these follow-up investigations using large datasets with a wide range of phenotypic information and summary association data. In this talk, I will give an overview of GWAS and post-GWAS studies, describe the current challenges and limitations, and discuss the motivations to develop new statistical methods to investigate the genetics of complex traits.
