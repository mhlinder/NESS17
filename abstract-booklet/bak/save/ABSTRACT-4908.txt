The generation of millennials is phasing out of undergraduate courses and the next generation is replacing them. Titled “Generation Z” these students were born into a world with technology where their phones contained the answers to nearly any question they could ask. In response to this changing landscape of learners and their new educational needs, we implemented additional feedback procedures (weekly quizzes with varying grade incentives, an introductory survey and two SATS-36 surveys) in an introductory biostatistics course at the University of Rhode Island. Our purpose was two-fold. First, explore the effect of grade incentives on weekly quizzes by building a piecewise linear mixed effect longitudinal model. Next, investigate the change in attitudes throughout the semester using multiple linear regression to control for the starting attitude of the students. Results from this analysis will be extended to a larger goal to model URI undergraduate students’ attitudes towards statistics and its relationship with course outcomes.
