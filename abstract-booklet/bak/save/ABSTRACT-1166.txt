Estimating the effect of an infectious disease intervention
in a single interconnected population is challenging because subjects
may transmit infection to others. Preventive treatment (e.g.
vaccination) may exert a direct effect on the person who receives it,
and may protect others by preventing infection in the recipient and
thereby transmission to someone else, or by reducing the recipient’s
infectiousness when infected. We outline a causal framework for
estimating the direct and indirect effects of a vaccine in a single
networked population. Epidemiological assumptions collapse subjects’
outcomes over time into cumulative exposures experienced by
susceptible subjects; conditional independence assumptions permit
identification of the direct effect and partition of the indirect
effect into distinct effects on susceptibility and transmissibility. I
describe a semi-parametric class of infectious disease regression
models motivated by a continuous-time Markov stochastic epidemic
process. I describe the consequences of misspecification of the
infection model, and discuss approaches to estimation when either the
network or time series of infections are incompletely observed.
