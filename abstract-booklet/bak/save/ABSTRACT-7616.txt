The widespread availability of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to usher in the era of personalized medicine. However, the problem of extracting useful clinical representations from longitudinal EHR data remains challenging, owing to the heterogeneous, longitudinally irregular, noisy and incomplete nature of such data.

In this talk, we will focus on the problems of high dimensionality and temporality. We explore deep neural network models with learned medical feature embedding to deal with these issues. Specifically, we use a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to parameterize the model and is thus able to capture complex non-linear longitudinal evolution of EHRs. To account for high dimensionality, we extended the word2vec model and use the embedded medical features in the CNN model. Experiments on real-world EHR data demonstrate the effectivenes of the proposed method.
