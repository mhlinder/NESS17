In this talk, we will study the intraday trading activity of U.S. stocks from ten sectors using a new class of parameter-driven models for multivariate count time series that may not be stationary. With the  model proposed by F. Wang and H. Wang (2016), we formulate the mean process of trading volume and frequency as the product of modulating factors and unobserved stationary processes. The former characterizes the long-run movement in the trading activity, while the latter is responsible for rapid fluctuations and other unknown or unavailable exogenous/endogenous covariates. The unobserved stationary processes evolve independently of the past observed counts, and might interact with each other. The unobserved processes are further modeled as a linear combination of possibly low-dimensional common factors that govern the contemporaneous and serial correlation within and across the observed counts. With the proposed models, we extract the common factors from the intraday trading volume and  frequency of 40 liquid stocks in the first quarter of 2012. Dynamic relationship between common factors adjusted by their associated loading and intraday volatility also investigated.
