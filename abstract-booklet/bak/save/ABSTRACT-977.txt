Large-scale businesses need to have a clear vision of how well they expect to perform within all their different units. This information will directly impact managerial decisions that will in turn affect the future health of the company. In this talk, we focus on the statistical challenges that occur when implementing our revenue forecasting methodology on a weekly basis within a large business. We must provide reasonably accurate forecasts for all the geography/division combinations, which have fundamentally different revenue trends and patterns over time. Our method must be robust to “oddities”, such as typos in the input or unusual behavior in the data. In addition, our forecasts must be stable over weeks, without sacrificing on accuracy. We describe the statistical methods used to maintain an efficient and effective operational solution.
