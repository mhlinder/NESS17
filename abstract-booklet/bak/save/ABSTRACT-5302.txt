Highway road signs displaying witty messages promoting safe driving are not an uncommon sight on the morning commute in New England, especially around major holidays. As departments of transportation and public health and safety place more emphasis on safe driving, understanding factors that affect the occurrence of motor vehicle accidents is becoming increasingly relevant. The aim of this analysis was to investigate periodic day of week and day of year effects and the influence of certain holidays on counts of fatal accidents in the United States. Using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), we examined patterns in the number of fatal car accidents from 1975 to 2015 using a nonparametric Gaussian process model with additive components. Special days included in the analysis were New Year’s Eve and Day, Valentine’s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Our results demonstrate a day of week effect, a day of year effect, and an effect of certain special days. This approach can be used to inform the timing of interventions and allocation of resources aimed at reducing road traffic accidents at particular times of the week, year, and around holidays.
