Inference functions, such as the likelihood, are widely used throughout statistics. They have the virtue of providing methods for point estimation, set estimation, and hypothesis testing.
Researchers often perform  inferences based on the asymptotic theory.  
But, the asymptotic-based inferences may not be reliable if the amount of available information is not large relative to the number of parameters. 
To address this long-standing problem, we have developed the methodologies to assess the adequacy of using the asymptotic
theory for finite-sample inference.  They are based on confidence distribution sampling and volumetric error analysis.
