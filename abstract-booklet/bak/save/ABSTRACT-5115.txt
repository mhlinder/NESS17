We consider the association of a time-dependent binary treatment or exposure with time-to-event under the proportional hazard model. The exposure value is assumed zero at the beginning of the study and may change to one at any time point. The value of the exposure is observed only in certain time points, and thus its exact value is unknown for some participants, in each risk set. We are motivated by the assessment of post colorectal cancer diagnosis aspiring taking and survival. Na√Øve and popular methods are potentially biased, especially when the exposure is measured at a small number of time points. We present a class of calibration models that fit a distribution for the time to exposure starting time. Estimates obtained from these models are then incorporated in the partial likelihood in a natural way. We derive asymptotic theory for these methods. Our methodology allows for inclusion of further baseline covariates affecting the initiation time of the exposure of interest.  Certain bias is expected from our methods when the exposure effect is large, and we provide a less-biased alternative using a risk set calibration approach.
