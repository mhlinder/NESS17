Crohn’s Disease is a life-long condition associated with recurrent relapses characterized by abdominal
pain, weight loss, anemia, and persistent diarrhea. In the U.S., there are approximately 780,000 Crohn’s disease
patients and 33,000 new cases are added each year. In this paper, we propose a new network meta-regression approach
for modeling ordinal outcomes in order to assess the eﬃcacy of treatments for Crohn’s disease. Speciﬁcally, we develop
regression models based on aggregate trial-level covariates for the underlying cut-oﬀ points of the ordinal outcomes
as well as for the variances of the random eﬀects to capture heterogeneity across trials. Our proposed models are
particularly useful for indirect comparisons of multiple treatments that have not been compared head-to-head within
the network meta-analysis framework. Moreover, we introduce Pearson residuals to detect outlying trials and construct
an invariant test statistic to evaluate goodness-of-ﬁt in the setting of ordinal outcome meta-data. A detailed case
study demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology is carried out using aggregate ordinal outcome data
from 16 clinical trials for treating Crohn’s disease.
