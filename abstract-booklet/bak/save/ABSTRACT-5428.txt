When large amounts of survival data arrive in streams, conventional estimation
methods are difficult to implement due to the requirement of storing
all the risk sets up to each accumulation point. In this paper, we apply
the cumulative estimating equation(CEE) and cumulatively updating estimating
equation(CUEE) to estimate the parameters for the Cox proportional hazards
model. Also, to ensure that the proportional hazards assumption holds over time
so that all estimators are valid,  we propose an online-updating test statistic
 as well as its variations for the proportional hazards assumption. Their
 reference distributions are also derived. In simulation studies and real
 data applications, the test statistic effectively identifies the failure of
 assumptions and is computationally
 efficient.
