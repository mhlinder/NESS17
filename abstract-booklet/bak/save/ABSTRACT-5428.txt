For big survival data, conventional estimation methods for Cox
proportional hazards models may become infeasible with standard
routines because of the limit of computer memory. With big stream data
partitioned into blocks, an online updating approach with cumulative
estimating equations and cumulatively updated estimating equations is
developed with minimal storage requirement to estimate the Cox model
parameters. The methodology naturally leads to an online updating test
procedure for the proportional hazards assumption. For certain
specific alternatives, window versions of the cumulative statistic
help to detect change point sooner. The proposed test procedures is
shown to be hold their sizes and have substantial power in simulation
studies. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated with a real
application to prostate cancer.
