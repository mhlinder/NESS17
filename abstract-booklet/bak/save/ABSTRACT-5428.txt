When large amounts of survival data arrive in streams, conventional estimation
methods are difficult to implement due to the requirement of storing 
all the risk sets up to each accumulation point. In this paper, we apply 
the cumulative estimating equation(CEE) and cumulatively updating estimating
equation(CUEE) to estimate the parameters for the Cox proportional hazards 
model. Also, to ensure that the proportional hazards assumption holds over time
so that all estimators are valid,  we propose an online-updating test statistic
 as well as its variations for the proportional hazards assumption. Their 
 reference distributions are also derived. In simulation studies and real 
 data applications, the test statistic effectively identifies the failure of 
 assumptions and is computationally 
 efficient.
