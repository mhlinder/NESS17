Typical studies in distributional robustness involve computing worst-case bounds for the quantity of interest (such as expected risk, probability of default, etc.) regardless of the probability distribution used, as long as the distribution lies within a prescribed tolerance (measured in terms of a probabilistic divergence like KL divergence) from a suitable baseline model. 

With this practice of computing worst-case bounds over probabilistic distance based neighborhoods gaining popularity, we go beyond the standard choice of KL divergence to study the role of putative model uncertainty in the context of estimation of tail probabilities or quantiles. In particular, we precisely   characterise  the worst-case extreme value index in order to answer “how heavy the tails of neighboring distributions can be?”. This study seeks to understand the qualitative properties of probabilistic distance based neighborhoods in order to guide the selection of model ambiguity regions for estimating extreme quantiles.
