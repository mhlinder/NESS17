We use cell tower data to measure communities' ability to respond, withstand and recover from adverse situations. There have recently been calls for significant investments in infrastructure to develop and fortify community resilience. However, resilience has been a difficult concept to quantify, and associated studies tend to be ad-hoc or community specific. We will explore the use of aggregate movement of individuals within a community to measure resiliency. The effect of Hurricane Matthew is used as a case study. We will show the effect of the hurricane on human mobility and identify communities that were particularly hard-hit and slow to respond.
