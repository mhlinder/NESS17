In non-network settings, encouragement designs have been widely used to analyze causal effects of a treatment, policy, or intervention on an outcome of interest when randomizing the treatment was considered impractical or when compliance to treatment cannot be perfectly enforced. Unfortunately, such questions related to treatment compliance have received less attention in network settings and the most well-studied experimental design in networks, the two-stage randomization design, requires perfect compliance with treatment. The paper proposes a new experimental design called peer encouragement design to study network treatment effects when enforcing treatment randomization is not feasible. The key idea in peer encouragement design is the idea of personalized  encouragement, which allows point-identification of familiar estimands in the encouragement design literature. The paper also defines new causal estimands, local average network effects, that can be identified under the new design and analyzes the effect of non-compliance behavior in randomized experiments on networks.
