Regression analysis constitutes a large portion of the statistical repertoire in applications. In case
where such analysis is used for exploratory purposes with no previous knowledge of the structure
one would not wish to impose any constraints on the problem. But in many applications we are
interested in a simple parametric model to describe the structure of a system with some prior
knowledge of the structure. An important example of this occurs when the experimenter has the
strong belief that the regression function changes monotonically in some or all of the predictor
variables in a region of interest. Especially in autoregressive models, one can assume that some of
parameters are positive (or negative). The analyses needed for statistical inference under such
constraints are nonstandard. The specific aim of this study is to introduce a technique, which can
be used for statistical inferences of a multiple linear regression with some non-standard constraints.
