The advanced smartwatch has multiple functionalities that includes measurements of physiological parameters such as heart rate, galvanic skin resistance(GSR), temperature, acceleration, etc.Analysis of Multifaceted sensor data provides us with the scope of tracking physiological, behavioral and environmental information.This work aims to find the correlation between the various sensor modalities using standard multivariate time series analysis.The correlation analysis proposed in this paper can be instrumental in differentiating actual medical condition and an artifact anomaly.This analysis can bring new insight into the possible hidden relationship between the sensor modalities and hence can be useful in recognizing the neurological state of the user.
