We propose an experimental design for testing whether the stable unit value assumption holds, by comparing two different estimates of the total treatment effect obtained through two different assignment strategies: a completely randomized assignment and a cluster-based randomized assignment. We provide a methodology for obtaining these two estimates simultaneously and provide theoretical guarantees for rejecting the null hypothesis that the stable unit value assumption holds without specifying a model of interference. We provide a discussion on how to apply our methodology to large internet experimentation platforms. Finally, we illustrate the proposed multilevel design to a live experiment on the LinkedIn platform.
