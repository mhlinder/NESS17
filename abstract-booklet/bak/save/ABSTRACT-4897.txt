Stagewise estimation is a slow-brewing approach for 
model building that has recently experienced a revival
due to its computational efficiency, its flexibility in 
handling complex data structure, and its intrinsic connections 
with penalized estimation. Built upon generalized estimating 
equations, we propose
general stagewise estimation approaches for variable and 
interaction selection in non-Gaussian/non-linear models with 
clustered data. As it is often required
that main effect terms be included when an interaction term is part of 
a model, the key is to perform variable selection that maintains
the variable hierarchy. We develop two techniques
to address this challenge. The first is a hierarchical
lasso stagewise estimating equations (hlSEE) approach,
which is shown to directly correspond to the hierarchical lasso
penalized regression. The second is an interaction stagewise
estimating equations (iSEE) approach, which enforces the variable 
hierarchy by conforming the selection to a properly growing active 
set in each stagewise estimation step. Simulation studies are presented
to show the efficacy and superior computational efficiency of the 
proposed approaches. We apply the proposed approaches to study the 
association between the suicide-related hospitalization rates of the
15--19 age group and the characteristics of the school districts in 
the State of Connecticut.
