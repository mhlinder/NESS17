Estimating average treatment effects in the presence of network interference has recently gained a lot of attention. It is well known that the classical versions of average treatment effects are no longer well defined when there is interference. We will investigate the issues that arise in defining and estimating average causal effects when there is arbitrary interference. We posit models for specifying various forms of interference through the concept of an \emph{exposure} neighborhood and develop a linear non-parametric representation of potential outcomes. Focusing on unbiased estimation (with respect to the randomization distribution), we will study two types of average causal effects. We will examine the pitfalls of ignoring interference and the consequences of using classical designs and estimators for estimating average causal effects. The classical difference-of-means estimators can have arbitrary bias. The nature and source of bias depends on the form of interference, which is unknown in general. On the other hand, Horvitz-Thompson estimators are unbiased as along as the correct weights are used; these weights depend on the form of interference. We also show that the H-T estimators are in-admissible for a large class of designs.
