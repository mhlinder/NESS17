Contemporary and ancient demographic structure in human populations has shaped the genomic variation observed in modern humans, and severely affected the distribution of functional and disease related genetic variation. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, researchers gather increasing amounts of genomic sequencing data for large samples in many different human population groups. These datasets present unprecedented opportunities to study genomic variation in complex demographic scenarios, and this area has received a lot of attention in recent years.


In this talk, I will present a method for the inference of demographic histories from full-genome sequencing data of multiple individuals developed by me and my collaborators. I will apply this method to a genomic dataset of Native American individuals to unravel the ancient demographic events underlying the peopling of the Americas. Morevoer, I will discuss a novel method for demographic inference that has the potential to improve inference especially in the recent past, which is of particular importance in the context of complex genetic diseases in humans.
