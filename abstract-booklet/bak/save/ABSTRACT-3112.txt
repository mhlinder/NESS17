Pollutant emissions from coal burning power plants have been deemed to adversely impact ambient air quality and public health conditions. Over the last few decades, many air quality control strategies targeting emissions have been adopted at the U.S. power plants. Despite noticeable reduction in emissions and the improvement of air quality since the Clean Air Act (CAA) became the law, the public-health benefits from changes in emissions have not been widely evaluated yet. In terms of the chain of accountability, the link between pollutant emissions and public health conditions with counting for changes in ambient air quality, we provide the first epidemiological assessment of the health effect of specific pollutant emission (SO2) that is mediated through change in the ambient air quality. Especially, we pursue the link from SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants (intervention) to ambient PM2.5 concentrations (mediator) estimated for each zip code and from ambient PM2.5 to cardiovascular- and respiratory-hospitalization and all causes mortality (outcomes). The main linkage is based on the HYSPLIT model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which simulates air mass trajectories from coal-fired power plants. To draw causality in the observational data, we use the potential outcomes framework with direct adjustment for confounding variables in the regression model. Then, we use a newly-developed Bayesian nonparametric method to provide flexible models to the observed data in two analyses: principal stratification analysis and mediation analysis. Both analyses are anchored to the same observed data model and used as the means to quantify the effects through two causal pathways: the extent to which SO2 emissions affect public health outcomes that is attributable to changes in ambient PM2.5 and the extent to which SO2 emissions directly affect public health outcomes.
