This work presents the first comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis that links reported and suspected cases of Dengue (recorded monthly in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2015 in 76 municipalities) with weather variables collected at 34 stations and land use satellite data. Dengue and Zika are mosquito-borne tropical diseases, reported with increasing rates in the last decade. Early warning systems help in predicting outbreaks and allow public health decision-makers to implement preventive measures. Several factors have been linked to the increase in reported cases: changes in temperature, precipitation, urbanization, and other spatial variables.  Several space-time CAR specifications are implemented in a Bayesian framework to assess the relative risk of these factors, as well as to set a predictive framework. The modeling strategy involves a two stage approach to account for the different spatial supports of predictors and response.
