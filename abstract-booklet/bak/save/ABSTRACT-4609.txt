Respondent-Driven Sampling (Heckathorn 1997) is a sampling method designed to collect data for hard-to-reach populations; injected drug users, sex workers, and man who have sex with man. Beginning with a convenience sample, the sample recruits other participants using small number of uniquely-identified coupons to distribute among his/her social network. Coupon recipients can accept or reject participation of the survey study, and he/she also get small number of coupon to recruit other participants. Using these process, survey team can reach a desire sample size of the target population.
This method is very effective to collect a data for hard-to-reach populations. However, valid statistical inference for these kinds of data relies on many strong assumptions. Most of all, statistical tests for between pairs of variables has strong limitation. In standard survey samples, we can assume the two pairs of variables from each individual are independent. In RDS condition, however, this assumption does not be satisfied because of the sampling dependence between individuals. Therefore, we propose to design methods to non-parametrically estimate the null distributions of standard test statistics in the presence of sampling dependence, allowing for more valid statistical testing.
