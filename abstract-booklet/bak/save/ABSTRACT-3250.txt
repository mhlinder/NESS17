 Detection and attribution (D\&A) analysis for climate extremes plays an
  important role in understanding the human influence on the observed change
  in climate extremes. Recent developed methodologies for D\&A analysis use
  signal estimated from climate model simulation under external forcing as
  covariate in the model of observed extremes and carry out statistical
  analysis on the coefficient of the signal. The estimated signal contains
  statistical error, however, which may yield bias in the following
  analysis. In this study, we propose a method which combines the two stages
  of signal estimation and D\&A analyis, and estimate the signal jointly
  from both the simulated and the observed extremes. We show that this
  method can reduce the bias effectively in the estimation compared to the
  previous method using a simulation study.
