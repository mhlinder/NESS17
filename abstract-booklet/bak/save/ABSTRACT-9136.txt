Europe is in the midst of the largest migration crisis the world has seen since WWII. Largely fueled by on-going conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, this mass migration is a multidimensional problem with numerous factors at play. To better understand this problem, we created a network representation of migration patterns between chosen countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Specifically, we observed the total number of refugees that migrated from one country to another in 2010 and 2015. One of our goals was to observe how migration patterns have changed over time and to understand what major events may have contributed to those changes. We also investigated various factors that could presumably influence migration patterns. We analyzed multiple descriptive measures of our network including degree and strength distribution, transitivity, assortativity, betweenness, graph partitioning, and node and edge attributes. We observed an overall increase in migration from 2010 to 2015, although we did observe a decrease in migration to and from some countries as well. For the most part, the changes we observed were consistent with recent world events. In the future, we plan to explore the use of dynamic networks, specifically, stochastic actor-based models for modelling the evolution of migration patterns over time. We also plan to explore the predictive capabilities of additional variables such as illegal border crossings, attitudes towards refugees, and legislation.
