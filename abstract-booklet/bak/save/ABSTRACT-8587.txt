We present a new way to estimate multivariate extreme value distributions (MVEVD) from data using max projections.
The approach works in any dimension, though computation time increases quickly as dimension increases.
The procedure requires tools from computational geometry and multivariate integration techniques.
An R package mevd is being developed to implement the method for several semi-parametric classes of MEVDs:
discrete angular measure, generalized logistic, piecewise linear angular measures, and Dirichlet mixture models.
