With advances in technologies, huge amounts of multiple types of high-throughput genomics data are available. These data have tremendous potential to identify new and clinically valuable biomarkers to guide the diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, and treatment of complex diseases. Integrating, analyzing, and interpreting big and noisy genomics data to obtain biologically meaningful results, however, remains highly challenging. Utilizing statistical machine learning methods can help to address these issues.
To facilitate the identification of a short list of biologically meaningful genes as candidate drivers of anti-cancer drug resistance from an enormous amount of heterogeneous data, we employed statistical machine-learning techniques and integrated genomics datasets. We developed a computational method that integrates gene expression, somatic mutation, and copy number aberration data of sensitive and resistant tumors. In this method, an integrative method based on regression tree and module network analysis is applied to identify potential driver genes. We applied this method to the ovarian cancer data from the cancer genome atlas. The method yields a short list of aberrant genes that also control the expression of their co-regulated genes. The final result contains biologically relevant genes, such as COL11A1, which has been recently reported as a cis-platinum resistant biomarker for ovarian carcinoma.
