In Alzheimer’s patients, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a commonly used measure of general cognitive function. Longitudinal cognitive patient reported outcomes (CPRO) in Alzheimer patients are often highly nonlinear. This nonlinear feature of the data violates the major assumptions of commonly used statistical models such as linear mixed-effect (LME) models and generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. An alternative approach to this issue involves the incorporation of time series methods for the latent trajectory in multivariate time series of the MMSE. Data from 432 participants of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center were used in this study. We examined the trajectories of participants’ MMSE across study visits (up to 8 visits) via time series plots. Next, we examined the assumptions of a LME model for the data, and investigated alternative models that correctly explains MMSE in our cohort. Time series plots revealed violations of the linearity assumption of MMSE as an outcome over time, and the plots appeared to exhibit a certain trend and random effects across time. When we fit an LME model, we observed no significant association for MMSE over time (p=0.3884). However, when we fit an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, namely ARIMA (1,1,1), we observed a significant improvement in model fit in comparison to the LME model. The findings from this study may deepen our understanding on how to unbiasedly and efficiently model longitudinal CPRO data in Alzheimer patients and provide more insights in the pathway of disease at the initial pre-symptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s disease.
