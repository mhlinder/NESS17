Estimation of the population attributable risk (PAR) has become an important goal in public health research, because it describes the proportion of disease cases that could be prevented if an exposure were entirely eliminated from a target population as a result of some intervention. In epidemiological studies, categorical covariates are often misclassified. We present methods for obtaining point and interval estimates of the PAR in the presence of misclassification, using a Bayesian approach to estimate parameters of the logistic regression models for the disease and for the misclassification process, under two different study designs. We compare this method to a likelihood-based method and we apply these to data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study of risk factors for colorectal cancer.
