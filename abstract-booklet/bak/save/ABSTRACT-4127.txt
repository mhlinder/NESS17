We consider the problem of statistical inference and prediction for
processes defined on networks. We assume that the network is known and measures similarity, 
and our goal is to learn about an attribute
associated with its vertices. Classical regression methods are not immediately
applicable to this setting, as we would like our model to incorporate
information from both network structure and pertinent covariates. Our proposed
model consists of a generalized linear model with vertex indexed predictors
and a basis expansion of their coefficients, allowing the coefficients to vary
over the network. We employ a regularization procedure, cast as a prior
distribution on the regression coefficients under a Bayesian setup, so that
the predicted responses vary smoothly according to the topology of the
network. We first motivate the need for this model by examining occurrences of
residential burglary in Boston, Massachusetts. Noting that crime rates are
not spatially homogeneous, and that the rates appear to vary sharply across
regions or hot zones in the city, we construct a hierarchical model that
addresses these issues and gives insight into spatial patterns of crime
occurrences. Furthermore, we examine an efficient expectation-maximization
fitting algorithm and provide computationally-friendly methods for eliciting
hyper-prior parameters. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model
in a simulation study and a case study in Boston.
