With the growing health costs in the United States, the need to improve the efficiency and efficacy
of care has become increasingly urgent. There has been great interest in developing interventions to
effectively coordinate the typically fragmented care of  patients with many comorbidities. Evaluation
of such interventions is often challenging given their long-term nature and their differential effectiveness among different patients. Given this and the resource intensiveness of care coordination interventions, there is significant interest in identifying which patients may benefit the most from care coordination. Identification of patients which benefit from a particular intervention can be accomplished by modeling covariates which modify the intervention effect. In this work we extend the interaction modeling framework of Tian, et al. (2014) and Chen, et al. (2017) to handle long-term interventions whose effects are expected to change smoothly over time. We  allow interaction effects to vary over time and encourage these effects to be more similar over time by utilizing a fused lasso penalty. Our approach allows for flexibility in modeling temporal effects while also borrowing strength in estimating these effects over time. We use our approach to identify a subgroup of patients who benefit from a complex case management intervention in a large hospital system.
