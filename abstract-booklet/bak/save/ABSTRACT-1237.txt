Randomly censored covariates arise frequently in epidemiologic studies. The most commonly used  methods, including complete case and single imputation or substitution, suffer from inefficiency and bias, they make strong parametric assumptions and they consider limit of detection censoring only.  We employ multiple imputation, in conjunction with semi-parametric modeling of the censored covariate, to overcome these shortcomings and to facilitate robust estimation. We develop a multiple imputation approach for randomly censored covariates within the framework of linear and logistic regression models.  We use the nonparametric estimate of the covariate distribution, or the semi-parametric Cox model estimate in the presence of additional covariates in the model.  We evaluate this procedure in simulations, and compare its operating characteristics to those from the complete case analysis and a survival regression approach.  We apply the procedures to an Alzheimerâ€™s study of the association between amyloid positivity and maternal age of onset of dementia.
