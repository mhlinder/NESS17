In this talk, we pursue a statistical non-parametric approach for spurt and downfall detection in activity profiles corresponding to real-time applications. While parametric approaches involve learning the underlying parameters, our approach is based on binning the count data of activity to form observation vectors that can be compared with each other. Motivated by a majorization theory framework, these vectors are then transformed via certain functionals and used in spurt classification. While the parametric approaches often result in either a large number of missed detections of real changes or false alarms, the proposed approach is shown to result in a small number of missed detections and false alarms. Further, the non-parametric nature of the approach 
makes it attractive for ready applications in a practical context. Performance of the proposed approach in a real terrorist monitoring application are presented.
