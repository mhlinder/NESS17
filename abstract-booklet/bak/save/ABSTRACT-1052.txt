It is of great practical importance to compare and combine data from different studies in order to carry out appropriate and more powerful statistical inference. In this paper, to quantify the compatibility of two data sets we first propose a partition based measure in terms of the corresponding posterior distributions of the parameters. We further propose an information gain to measure the information increase in combining two data sets. These measures are well calibrated. Efficient computational algorithms are developed for calculating these measures. We illustrate how these two measures are useful in combining historical data to current data with a benchmark toxicology example.
