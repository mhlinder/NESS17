Meta-analyses of clinical trial safety data have risen in importance beyond regulatory submissions. During drug development, pharmaceutical sponsors need to recognize safety signals early and adjust the development program accordingly, so as to facilitate the assessment of causality. Once a medicinal product is marketed, sponsors add post-approval clinical trial data to the body of information to help understand existing safety concerns or those that arise from other post-approval data sources, such as spontaneous reports. The situation becomes more involved when interest centers on a network comparison of multiple active treatments.  This presentation highlights some of the major issues considered in meta-analysis of safety data – such as sparse events, reporting quality, and limited study duration – and identifies gaps requiring special attention.
