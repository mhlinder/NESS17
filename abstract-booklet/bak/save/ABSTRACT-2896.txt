We investigate the effect of a joint survival and longitudinal models on the precision and accuracy of the longitudinal estimates. Mixed effects analysis has allowed investigators to incorporate more information in their models by allowing subjects to have repeated measures. More recently, joint models consisting of a cox proportional hazards model and a longitudinal mixed effects model have been proposed allowing investigators to additionally incorporate time-to-event data. By incorporating more information, we expect the estimates of the longitudinal portion of the joint model to be less biased and more precise on average. Extensive research has been done to show the improvement in estimation of the hazard function using joint models, but not much research has been done to investigate the differences in estimation of the longitudinal model. In this study, we compared the longitudinal model with the longitudinal portion of the joint model in terms of coverage, bias, and precision using the same simulation structure used previously (Mayeda, 2015). Our results showed that although the estimate of the longitudinal portion of the joint model was on average more precise, it had a higher root mean square error and was more susceptible to survival bias and type I error compared to the longitudinal model alone.
