Approximate Bayesian computing (ABC) is a likelihood-free method that has grown increasingly popular since early applications in population genetics. However, the theoretical justification for inference based on this method has yet to be fully developed especially pertaining to the use of non-sufficient summary statistics. We introduce a more general computational technique, approximate confidence distribution computing (ACC) to overcome two defects of the ABC method, namely, lack of theory supporting the use of non-sufficient summary statistics and lack of guardian for the selection of prior. Specifically, we establish frequentist coverage properties for the outcome of the ACC method by using the theory of confidence distributions, and thus inference based on ACC is justified (even if reliant upon a non-sufficient summary statistic). Furthermore, the ACC method is very broadly applicable; in fact, the ABC algorithm can be vi ewed as a special case of an ACC method without damaging the integrity of ACC based inference. We supplement the theory with simulation studies and an epidemiological application to illustrate the benefits of the ACC method. It is also demonstrated that a well-tended ACC algorithm can greatly increase its computing efficiency over a typical ABC algorithm.
