It is necessary to quantify the level of vaccine uptake among a population of interest in order to determine if the introduced vaccine has the desired beneficial impact on human health.  A number of data sources and methods are available to obtain this information at aggregated spatial levels for many vaccines.  However, obtaining an accurate assessment of uptake at more localized spatial scales can be a difficult task due to limitations of regularly collected administrative data.  Vaccine recipients often live in one region while being vaccinated in another, thereby complicating the process of calculating uptake within a region.  We introduce a spatial kernel smoothing method in the Bayesian setting that allows for estimation of local vaccine uptake through the combination of administrative and survey data sources.  The newly developed method is applied to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine uptake data from Brazil in 2013.  Results suggest that the method provides estimates of vaccine uptake at local levels that are in closer agreement to collected survey responses than the standard method that ignores the issue of participant mobility.  The method also provides insight into patterns of mobility of vaccine recipients based on the inclusion of region-specific covariates.
