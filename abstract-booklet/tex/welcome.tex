Welcome to the University of Connecticut!  I’m delighted that UConn is
hosting this conference on its 30th anniversary.  We are proud of our
Statistics department and honored by this opportunity to host
statisticians from across New England and provide a forum for them to
discuss emerging issues, share research expertise, and meet old
friends.
 
I’d like to particularly thank the Symposium’s local hosts and
organizers from UConn, Drs. Jun Yan, Haim Bar, Kun Chen, and Yuping
Zhang for their efforts in pulling this meeting together. \\[1em]
