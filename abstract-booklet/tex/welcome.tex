Dear NESS scholars,
Welcome!  We are pleased to host the New England Statistics Symposium again this year, especially as this marks the 31st anniversary of your program.  I understand that this year?s attendee list boasts more than 230 participants, from over 60 organizations across the nation plus several visitors from overseas.  I know that you will all benefit from engaging with your colleagues as you share research and discuss emerging issues in your field.  
Since its founding in 1939, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences has been the academic heart of the University of Connecticut. We take seriously the foundations of a liberal education: We teach students to think creatively and analytically; to reason from evidence; to respect the views and experiences of all members of our diverse community; and to continue learning throughout their lives, wherever their professional and personal journeys take them.  It is wonderful to hear that the NESS upholds these same values.
Best wishes, \\[1em]
