Community detection in networks is becoming increasingly important in many applications, especially in social sciences. Today's era of big data proposes a new challenge in this field---how to efficiently detect community structure on large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic blockmodel based on a logistic regression setup with group correction terms to better address this problem and conduct exact inference based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We demonstrate the novel proposed model and estimation on large real-world networks as well as simulated benchmark networks, and show that the proposed estimator performs better when compared to the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected stochastic blockmodels as well as other commonly used estimators suitable for large-scale networks.
