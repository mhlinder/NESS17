The effects of therapeutic intervention are difficult to assess for a number of diseases that progress through qualitatively different stages over several years. Different outcome variables, all understood to be reflective of a single disease process, may be more or less informative depending on the disease stage. In Alzheimer's Disease for example, certain memory assessments are very sensitive to change at the incipient and early stages of the disease and less so at later stages, while for instruments measuring other aspects of cognition, the reverse may be true. In this context, comprehensive analysis of data spanning multiple stages of the disease requires a joint (multivariate) longitudinal model. Our approach to this problem is to posit a latent (univariate) disease state that progresses continuously over time and that determines (via link functions) location parameters for individual outcome variables. We present an application of this approach in Alzheimer's Disease. Brief remarks will be made regarding model identifiability, diagnostics, and the "value added" over separate univariate longitudinal models.
