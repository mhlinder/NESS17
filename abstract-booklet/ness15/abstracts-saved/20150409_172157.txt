We consider testing for independence in each of several sparse two-way contingency tables. Techniques of small area estimation are used to construct a pooled Bayes test via a hierarchical Bayesian model. We use the Bayes factor to construct the pooled Bayes test and the required 
marginal likelihoods are estimated in a unified manner. We show how to obtain the Monte Carlo estimator of the Bayes factor and its standard error. An example is used to compare the pooled Bayes test with two direct (no pooling) tests, Cressie-Read power divergence test and a  Bayes 
test. The three tests give similar evidence against independence for moderate to large areas, but there are some differences for smaller areas. As expected, while the direct Bayes test is sensitive to the prior specifications, the pooled  Bayes test is not so sensitive. Moreover, 
for relatively small areas the pooled Bayes test has higher power than the two competitors. Finally, we discuss how to improve the pooled Bayes test even further using surrogate sampling for covariates and the Dirichlet process for robustification.
