Accidental deaths from car crashes claim more teenager lives than any other causes in the United States. Graduated Driver's Licensing (GDL) is one of the effective policies adopted in North America to reduce the occurrences of fatal car accidents for teenage-drivers. Many studies have reported the effectiveness of GDL in the US with temporal models and recently by also considering spatial variations.  This article studies the effectiveness of GDL with spatial random effects models fitting on data from the state of Michigan collected from databases publicly available. When a multiplicative measurement error term,  the rate of teenage-drivers in the teenage population in Michigan, is integrated in the model, the effectiveness of GDL is totally absorbed in that  the reduction of fatal car accidents after the implementation of GDL is completely explained by the drop of teenage driver rates in the same period of time. Hence we are able to discover the mechanism in how GDL policies take effect.  Identifying the holding rates of teenage-drivers license as a underlying factor for risk reduction, this article provides a new perspective for further policy refining.
