Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is widely used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests with continuous or ordinal responses. A popular study design for assessing the accuracy of diagnostic tests involves multiple readers interpreting multiple diagnostic test results, called the multi-reader, multi-test design. I will introduce a novel power formula to compare the correlated areas under the ROC curves (AUC) in a multi-reader, multi-test design.  In particular, I will describe a nonparametric approach to estimate and compare the correlated AUCs by extending DeLong et al.â€™s (1988) approach.
