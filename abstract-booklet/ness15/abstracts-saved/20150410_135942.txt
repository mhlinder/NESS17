Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a sampling method designed to collect data from hard-to-reach populations; injected drug users, sex workers, and man who have sex with man. Data are collected through a peer-referral process in which members of an initial convenience sample recruit additional members connected through their social networks. Unfortunately, inference from RDS data requires many strong assumptions that may not hold in practice. Therefore we need to check several diagnostics during the data collection of an RDS study. The target population of this study consists of New York City young adult prescription opioid or heroin drug users. I apply diagnostic tools to explore features of the data and collection including homophily, seed bias, and differential recruitment.
