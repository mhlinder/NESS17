The problem of induction is an interesting problem in science.
Laplace, Jeffreys and Good are some of the famous names who 
have used probabilistic or statistical approaches.  We shall 
discuss a Bayesian approach and in particular consider the 
selection of priors.  We present classes of priors for which 
the Bayes factor does not depend on the population size.
