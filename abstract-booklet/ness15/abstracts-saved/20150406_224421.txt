The broad adoption of social media has led to new opportunities in understanding and leveraging peer influence. However, in order to quantify the causal effect of peer influence, we need to overcome some new challenges including: interference and dependencies between units in a social network, complex functions of unit response to treatments on the network, and network uncertainty. Here, we introduce novel causal estimands of peer-influence under a principled extension of the potential outcomes framework for causal inference, and develop two procedures to estimate them: a sampling procedure that requires knowledge of the network, but which can operate under complicated (e.g., non-linear) response, and a Bayesian procedure that accounts for social network uncertainty, but relies on a linear model for unit response. We are able to characterize bias-information trade-offs. In the sampling procedure, randomizations that identify more information about the causal estimand may lead to more biased estimates, depending on the network topology that is being conditioned on. In contrast, the Bayesian procedure utilizes information on the network topology to achieve more precise estimates; however, bias is introduced when the linearity assumption does not hold. We experiment on various popular network topologies and unit response functions, which highlights the comparative advantages of the two aforementioned procedures.
