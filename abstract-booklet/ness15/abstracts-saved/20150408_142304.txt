Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a great success in the past decade, with tens of thousands of loci identified associated with many complex diseases in humans. However, challenges still remain in both identifying new risk loci and interpreting results. Bonferonni-corrected significance level is a very conservative threshold for high dimensional hypothesis testing, leading to insufficient statistical power when the effect size is moderate at each risk locus. Complex structure of linkage disequilibrium also makes it challenging to distinguish causal variants from large haplotype blocks. In this paper, we propose a post-GWAS prioritization method that integrates genomic functional annotation and GWAS test statistics. We apply our method to GWAS results for Crohnâ€™s disease and schizophrenia, and test the performance using the largest studies available. After prioritization, highly ranked loci show substantially stronger signals in the testing dataset than the top loci before prioritization. At the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, SNPs after prioritization have both higher replication rates and consistently stronger enrichment of eQTLs. Within each risk locus, our method is able to distinguish real signal sources from groups of correlated SNPs. Our method has the potential to be widely used to reveal functional spots at disease-associated risk loci and guide further studies such as resequencing analysis.
