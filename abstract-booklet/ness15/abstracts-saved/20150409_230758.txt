Community detection is a fundamental statistical problem in network data analysis. Many algorithms have been proposed in literature to tackle this problem. However, these algorithms are not guaranteed to achieve the statistical optimality of the problem. Moreover, procedures that achieve information theoretic lower bounds for very general parameter spaces are not computationally tractable. In this paper, we present a computationally feasible two-stage method that achieves optimal statistical performance in misclassification proportion for stochastic block model under very weak regularity conditions. Our two-stage procedure consists of a generic refinement step that can take a wide range of weakly consistent clustering procedures as initializer, to which the refinement stage applies and outputs clustered nodes with optimal misclassification proportion. The practical effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated by compatible numerical results.
