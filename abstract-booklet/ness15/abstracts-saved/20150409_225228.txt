Outbreaks of influenza pose a serious threat to communities and hospital 
resources. It is important for health care providers not only to know 
the seasonal trend of influenza, but also to be alarmed when unusual outbreaks 
occur as soon as possible for more efficient, proactive resource allocation.
Google Flu Trends data showed a good match in trend patterns, albeit not in 
exact occurrences, with the hospitalization counts due to influenza from 
the Center for Disease Control, and, hence, provide a timely, inexpensive
data source to develop an alarm system for outbreaks of influenza.
For the State of Connecticut, using weekly Google Flu Trends data 
from 2003 to 2012, an exponentially weighted moving average control chart
was developed after removing the trend from the observed data.
The control chart was tested with the 2013 data, and was able 
to issue an alarm at the unusually earlier outbreak in January, 2013.
