The penalized variable selection methods have been extensively studied for standard time-to-event data. Such methods, cannot be directly applied when subjects are at risk of several mutually exclusive events, known as competing risks. The proportional subdistribution hazard (PSH) model proposed by Fine and Gray has become a popular semi-parametric model for time-to-event data with competing risks. It allows for direct assessment of covariate effects on the cumulative incidence function. In this paper, we propose a general penalized variable selection strategy that simultaneously handles variable selection and parameter estimation in the PSH model. We rigorously establish the asymptotic properties for the proposed penalized estimators and present a numerical algorithm for implementing the variable selection procedure. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method. Diseased donor kidney transplant data from the United Network of Organ Sharing illustrate the utility of the proposed method.
