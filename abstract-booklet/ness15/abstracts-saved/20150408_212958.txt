Chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection indicates lung function deterioration in children cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Modeling the onset time of chronic PA infection is important for clinicians to devise better treatment plan and patient management. Due to the scheduled visits for patients in the cystic fibrosis foundation patient registry (CFFPR) and the definition of chronic PA infection, the onset time is only known up to a certain interval. The analysis is further challenged by the need to allow some risk factors to have time-varying effects on the onset time. This problem fits into the framework of Bayesian dynamic Cox model for interval censored data recently developed by Wang, Chen, and Yan (2013, Lifetime Data Analysis 19:297--316). Application of the methodology to the onset time of chronic PA infection of children CF patients revealed interesting findings. Compared with patients diagnosed via new born screening, patients diagnosed via meconium ileus or other symptoms had moderately higher risks of acquiring chronic PA infections before age two. Two cohorts of five years apart were compared, and patients in the more recent cohort were found to have lower risks of chronic PA infection throughout their first five years.
