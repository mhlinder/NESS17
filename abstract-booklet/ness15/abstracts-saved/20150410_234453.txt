Knowing a book a consumer is interested in buying, we can recommend some other titles likely to be found interesting.  This is a common feature of online retailers we are all used to seeing, but how could these recommendations be made?  Using a data set of political books co-purchased on Amazon in the early 2000’s, we performed statistical network analysis to explore the possibilities.

For a descriptive analysis of the resulting network graph characteristics we used simple node and edge counts, node degree analysis, and more sophisticated measures of centrality.  This gave a clearer picture of the books themselves, and which ones in particular were not only popular, but connected to the others.  This led us to questions about the cohesion of the graph.  How closely related are these books?  Are there definite purchasing patterns based on consumer politics?  Could we detect these communities without knowing the affiliations in advance?  We conducted local density tests, and computed joint node and marginal degree distribution analysis to try and formulate answers to these questions.  The communities of political leanings could indeed be detected from the purchasing patterns found in the data.  In fact, we were able to predict the political point of view of a theoretical unknown title from the known potential co-purchases.
Though this data set was manageable, we experimented with two data sampling techniques, induced and snowball.  The sampled data showed similar results as expected.

All of the analysis was automated using R, a statistical software environment.  We concluded that there are definite relationships between book co-purchases made on Amazon.  These data can be organized as a network, visualized and the patterns found within exposed and studied.  We confirmed that political affiliation can be determined based on buying habits, and even future purchases can be predicted.
