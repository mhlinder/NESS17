When comparing a new treatment with a control in a randomized clinical study, the treatment effect is generally assessed by evaluating a summary measure over a specific study population. The success of the trial heavily depends on the choice of such a population. In this research, we show a systematic, effective way to identify a promising subgroup, for which the new treatment is expected to have a desired benefit, using the data from current studies involving similar comparator treatments. Specifically, we first create a parametric scoring system using multiple covariates to estimate subject-specific treatment differences. Using this system, we specify a desired level of treatment difference and create a subgroup of patients, defined as those whose estimated scores exceed this threshold. An empirically calibrated group-specific treatment difference curve across a range of threshold values is constructed. The population of patients with any desired level of treatment benefit can then be identified accordingly. To avoid any ``self-serving'' bias, we utilize a cross-training-evaluation method for implementing the above procedure. At the final stage, we validate such a subgroup selection via two-sample inference procedures for assessing the treatment effectiveness statistically and clinically with a holdout sample. The proposals are illustrated with real data from a cardiovascular study.
