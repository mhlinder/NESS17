We consider the problem of quickest detection of an abrupt change when there is uncertainty about the post-change distribution. In particular we examine this problem in the continuous-time Wiener model where the drift of observations changes from zero to a drift randomly chosen from a collection. We set up the problem as a stochastic optimization in which the objective is to minimize a measure of detection delay subject to a frequency of false alarm constraint. We consider a composite rule involving the CUSUM reaction period, that is the time between the last reset of the CUSUM statistic process and the CUSUM alarm, and show that by choosing parameters appropriately, such a composite rule can be asymptotically optimal of third order in detecting the change point as the average time to the first false alarm increases without bound. Such a composite rule can also provide the information of the post-change distribution through the idea of its construction based on the uncertainty.
