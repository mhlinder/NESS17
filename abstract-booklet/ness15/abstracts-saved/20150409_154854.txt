An emerging business model in application software development in large enterprises is to employ a 
exible
workforce, or a resource pool, which consists of vetted freelancers, to support the application development
process, including software design, coding, and application testing. The success of this model
depends crucially on having the right participants at the right time when their skills are needed. However,
the need for each set of skills 
fluctuates over time, depending on the software development activities of the
business; the number of participants also fluctuates because participation is entirely voluntary and performed
via self-selection of work. Therefore, maintaining the appropriate capacity, or supply, of the resource pool
is an important and challenging problem for the service provider who utilizes this type of delivery platform. 
This talk will discuss statistical challenges in supply preditive analytics for a
resource pool operation in IBM's Global Business Services Division.
