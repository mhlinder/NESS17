In clinical trials, the monotone partial likelihood is frequently encountered in the  analysis of time-to-event data using the Cox model. When there are zero events in one or more covariate groups, the resulting partial likelihood is monotonic and consequently, the covariate effects are difficult to estimate. In this paper, we develop both Bayesian and frequentist approaches using Jeffreys' prior to handle the monotone partial likelihood problem. We first carry out an in-depth examination of the conditions of the monotone partial likelihood and then characterize sufficient and necessary conditions for the propriety of Jeffreys' prior. We also study several theoretical properties of Jeffreys' prior for the Cox model. In addition, we propose two variations of Jeffreys' prior. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to carry out posterior computation. We perform extensive simulations to examine the performance of parameter estimates and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by analyzing real data from a prostate cancer study in detail.
