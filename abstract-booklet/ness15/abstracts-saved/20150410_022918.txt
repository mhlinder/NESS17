Eliciting appropriate prior information from experts for a statistical
model is no easy task. Expressing this information in terms of
parameters of prior probability distributions on abstract model
parameters can be nearly impossible, especially after a data
augmentation/transformation procedure. In previous work on logistic
and binomial regression models, Hanson 2014 assert that
``experts are confident only in their assessment of the population as
a whole'' and propose a version of the $g$-prior which allows the
statistician or practitioner to effectively place a standard beta
distributed prior on the overall population probability of success. We
explore the efficacy of using the informed $g$-prior in a real
prediction problem involving electrical utility asset damages due to
hurricanes in Connecticut. Prior information is elicited from a group
of engineers at the electrical utility and several methods are used to
select hyper-parameters for the $g$-prior. The out-of-sample
predictive accuracy of these informed models is compared to the
performance of models constructed under common reference priors
(Jeffreys's, Gelman 2008, and a noninformative specification of the
$g$-prior) using IS-LOO, root mean squared error (RMSE), and other
statistics. We conclude that in this application with carefully
selected hyper-parameters, binomial regression models using the
informed $g$-prior match the predictive accuracy of common reference
priors and offer no distinct advantage. Careless selection of
hyper-parameters can however, lead to substantial reduction in
predictive accuracy. Surprisingly, the noninformative specification of
the $g$-prior performed marginally better than all other models tested
in this paper; contradicting one of the findings in Hanson 2014. In addition, we show the predictive accuracy gained by modeling spatial correlation in the residuals and prove that such models substantially outperform a class of statistical learning models growing in popularity in this field.
