Anyone dealing with large data knows that stock tools in R are bad at loading (non-binary) data to R. We present the iotools package that provides high-performance parsing tools to minimize copying and avoid the use of strings when possible. To allow processing of arbitrarily large files we have added way to process chunk-wise input, making it possible to compute on streaming input as well as very large files. Finally, the hmr package is an extension of iotools that wraps the fast loading and chunkwise processing to allow for seamless execution over files stored in a Hadoop cluster.
