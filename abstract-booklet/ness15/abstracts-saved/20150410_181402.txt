Understanding the interrelation between corporations and the industrial sectors that they comprise can be useful in the study of financial markets and economies. It would be advantageous if such relationships could be inferred without any preconceptions about a possible connection between two companies or industries. We selected a data set that consists of the adjusted closing prices for the companies that make up the Standard and Poor's 500 stock market index, gathered each day over a one year period. These were selected for two reasons: they are a well-known and widely accepted indicator of stock market performance, and they represent companies with large market capitalization in a variety of industrial sectors. We propose that the correlation coefficient between the price data of stocks may be one indicator of a relationship between the companies. More specifically, we construct a partial correlation association network over the time series data set. This accounts for the influence that outside attributes (in this case the other companies) have on each pairing. Since calculating the successive correlations creates a multiple testing problem, we apply a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment in order to restrict the false discovery rate to under five percent. We then visualize the resulting graph and use community detection to gain insights into the meaning of the links it represents. We explore how the correlation between stock market price data demonstrates a relationship between certain market sectors and evaluate how accurately the industry membership of a company can be predicted based on the companies to which it is correlated.
