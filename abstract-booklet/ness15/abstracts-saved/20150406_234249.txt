We present a machine learning algorithm for building classifiers that are comprised of a small number of disjunctions of conjunctions (or's of and's). An example of a classifier of this form is as follows: If X satisfies (conditions A1, A2, and A3) OR (conditions B1 and B2) OR (conditions C1 and C2), then we predict that Y=1, ELSE predict Y=0. Models of this form have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they produce a set of conditions that concisely describe a specific class. We present two probabilistic models for forming a pattern set, one with a Beta-Binomial prior, and the other with Poisson priors. In both cases, there are prior parameters that the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape, to conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide two methods for finding maximum a posteriori solutions: a pattern level search, which involves association rule mining, and a literal-based search, both of which scale nicely. We provide theoretical bounds that motivate our optimization techniques, showing how stronger priors  provably aid computation.
We apply the BOA model to predict user behavior with respect to in-vehicle context-aware personalized recommender systems.
