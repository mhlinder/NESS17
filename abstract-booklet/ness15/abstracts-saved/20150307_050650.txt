The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been used in children for over a decade, and there is an ongoing debate about whether adults should also receive the vaccine.  The original PCV targeted seven of the 90+ pneumococcal serotypes, and pediatric immunization had a strong indirect effect on the incidence of disease in adults.  However, despite the impact of indirect protection, the burden of pneumococcal disease in adults remains high.  Adult disease cases in the post-PCV period are caused by non-vaccine serotypes and, to a lesser degree, by the persistence of vaccine-targeted serotypes.  The use of PCVs in adults would be justified if the vaccine-targeted serotypes persist at a high level in some communities.  Using previously collected surveillance data from the state of Connecticut, 1998-2009, we introduce new methodology in the Bayesian setting to determine whether there are communities where vaccine-targeted serotypes cause a disproportionately large percentage of adult disease cases in the post-PCV period.  Our individual-level probit regression model jointly allows for the possibility of spatially varying baseline probabilities of disease caused by vaccine-targeted serotypes, spatially varying rates of decline of these probabilities over time, and spatially varying dates at which this decline begins in the adult population.  Results suggest that considering spatial variability in the parameters leads to improved model fit in terms of explanation and prediction of the process.  We further explore the results to determine if the spatial variability in the dates where the decline begins can be explained by spatially varying covariates and to validate the proposed models.
