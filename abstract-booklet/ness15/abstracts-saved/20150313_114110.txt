Statistical methods for phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary inference rely on simple Markov models of speciation, DNA sequence mutation, continuous trait evolution, and geographic movement over evolutionary timescales. Speciation is modeled as a stochastic branching process that gives rise to a phylogenetic tree. A second stochastic process representing trait, sequence, or location change then evolves over the branches of this tree, producing dependencies in the observations at the tips. In this talk, I will outline recent results on Markov models for evolutionary processes on random trees.  The results give insight into phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary inference for applications in experimental design, mutation rate estimation, and phylogeography.
