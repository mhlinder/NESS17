In this talk I will show how disjoint and compact bases provide a natural and intuitive approach to modeling spatial and spatio-temporal point processes. I will argue that inducing spatially compact bases allows for more intuitive representation of many real-world point processes. I will demonstrate how such a result can be obtained through non-negative matrix factorization, and subsequently extend this idea to a full generative model.
