ABSTRACT. In this paper, we study statistical inference for small-noise perturbations of multiscale dynamical systems. We prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of an appropriately constructed maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for a parameter of interest, identifying precisely the limiting variance. We allow unbounded coefficients in the equation for the slow process and assume neither periodicity nor that the fast process is compact - ergodicity of the fast process is guaranteed by imposing a recurrence condition. The results provide a theoretical basis for calibration of small-noise perturbed multiscale dynamical systems and related diffusion processes. Data from numerical simulations are provided to supplement and illustrate the theory.
