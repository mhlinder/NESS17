A central challenge in modeling infectious diseases is accurately estimating the (largely unobservable) population of individuals who are susceptible to infection. In this talk, I will review methods used to infer the susceptible fraction from time-series data and incorporate these estimates into models of disease transmission. Additionally, I will propose a new approach to accounting for the susceptible population over time based on observed case data. This method provides a simple way to include complex dynamics in otherwise standard statistical time-series models. Using over four decades of surveillance data on dengue fever infections from the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, I will compare the ability of these methods to draw inference about mechanistic disease transmission models.
