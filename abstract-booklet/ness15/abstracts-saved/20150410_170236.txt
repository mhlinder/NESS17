Many longitudinal health care studies involve repeated measurements of medical cost and time to event data. It is always complicated to estimate the average total medical cost for a specific group or population due to (1) the presence of censoring during follow-up time, (2) the semicontinuous nature of medical costs data, i.e. the data has a spike of zero followed by a right-skewed distribution of positive values, and (3) the rapid increase of medical costs prior to death, caused by the intensive treatment for patients who are dying. A joint modeling approach on survival and longitudinal data has proven to be valuable in end of life applications, especially when there is high mortality rate. Also, two-part models are commonly used in analyzing semicontinous data. Here we propose to develop and implement a novel joint modeling approach, a terminal trend model, based on the terminal decline model (by Li et al.) to produce individual level trajectories of the censored longitudinal semicontinuous data. The model is capable of capturing the terminal increasing/decreasing trend of the data. This approach includes two sub-models: one is a two-part spline regression model involving retrospective analysis of the odds of being positive and the distribution of positive values for medical costs, and the other is a piecewise exponential survival model. The model will be applied to Medicare data from a longitudinal study of secondary fracture prevention intervention in elder people. Osteoporotic fractures are recognized as a significant public health problem, especially for the elderly population, because of the associated substantial morbidity, mortality and treatment costs. The aging of the U.S. population in the following decades will make it a more critical issue. Also, elders with osteoporosis-related fracture have a dramatically increased risk of subsequent fracture within the first year following the initial fracture. The terminal trend model will provide estimates on costs and life expectancy of fracture patients in different intervention groups. These estimates will be applied in cost effectiveness analyses, which could help policy makers maximize health benefits. A simulation program has been developed using R to build a realistic dataset. The program simulates covariates such as age, gender, race and time to secondary fracture. Two outcomes, time to death and monthly costs are also simulated in the program with censoring. In the simulation, both time to secondary fracture and time to death are simulated using piecewise exponential distributions. The simulation data will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the terminal trend model and validate the estimated parameter.
