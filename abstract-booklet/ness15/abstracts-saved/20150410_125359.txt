Competing risks setting, which patients may fail due to different events, frequently arises in survival area. Recently, Ge and Chen (2012) introduced the fully-specified subdistribution model with subdistribution hazard for the primary event of interest and conditional hazards for the competing risks. In the present study, a modification of the fully-specified subdistribution model is proposed. We consider a piecewise function for the primary event of interest in which first piece is followed by a Weibull model and the second piece is followed by an exponential form such that $H(\infty)<\infty$, and a weibull model for the competing risk. Bayesian approach is applied for parameter estimation. In addition, the proposed model is fitted to a real clinical data set.
