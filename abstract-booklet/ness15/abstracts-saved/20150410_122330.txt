Changepoint detection has a rich and multifaceted history with a rich array of problems having been explored over the past few decades. Much of this attention however has been on the i.i.d. problem, where the observations are independent and identically distributed, both before and after change and with the distributional parameters known. The increased focus on big data problems in statistics as well as emerging applications of changepoint detection in complex networks such as social and terrorist networks brings in a diverse array of problems, hitherto not studied. This talk discusses multiple challenges in this setting such as modeling the data, modeling the changepoint(s), tradeoffs between parametric vs. non-parametric approaches in detecting the change, etc.
