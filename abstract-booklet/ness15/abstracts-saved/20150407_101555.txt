The marginal likelihood is commonly used for comparing different evolutionary models in Bayesian phylogenetics. But how to estimate the marginal likelihood of the variable tree topology is still challenging. We apply Larget's idea to Chib's method and then develop a new general method Weighted Chib's method. It uses more than one tree topology to estimate the variable tree topology marginal likelihood and gives more efficient result. We also compare our methods with Generalized Stepping Stone method for rbcL chloroplast DNA sequences example.
