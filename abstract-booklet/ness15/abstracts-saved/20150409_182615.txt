Although we never worked on a joint project, I was very fortunate to spend many enjoyable and memorable hours with Evarist, during which we discussed probability (among other things). One time, several years ago, Evarist enthusiastically told me about his favorite proof in undergraduate probability. I vividly remember this conversation. In this talk I'll reminisce about this conversation and how it got me to start working on a new major line of research.
