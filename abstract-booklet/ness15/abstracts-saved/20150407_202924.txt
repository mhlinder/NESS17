How a researcher chooses to handle incomplete records can dramatically affect the result of statistical analyses.  Differential entropy measures the uncertainty in a model which describes a data set, and common sense tells us this measure should increase when there are incomplete records.  However, the effect of missing values on entropy has never been quantified.  We utilize multiple imputation to examine the effect of missing values on the entropy of the bivariate normal data model.  Results include new theorems to quantify entropy of incomplete data, simulation studies to illustrate the effect of a variety of missingness percentages on entropy, and a comparison of the behavior of entropy of the incomplete data model and the fraction of missing information, a bi-product of multiple imputation.
