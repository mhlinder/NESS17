Randomized matrix compression techniques such as the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform  have emerged as an effective method for accelerating classical numerical linear algebra tasks, such as solving least squares problems. Yet, the aggressive compression introduces noise in the problem solution which can significantly degrade its quality.  In this paper, we propose mechanisms for improving the solution quality of matrix sketching for least squares problems. We introduce tools from robust optimization together with a form of partial compression to improve the error-time tradeoff of sketching-based compressed least squares solvers. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting robust optimization formulation. Empirical results comparing numerous alternatives suggest that aggressive randomized transforms are effectively insulated with partial compression and robustification.
