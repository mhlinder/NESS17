During the past few decades, both the frequency and severity of heat waves have an upward trend across the globe. At the same time, the average global temperature also shows an increasing pattern. Is it possible that there is any link between these two phenomena? Or is it only a coincidence? To make the question more concrete, is there a likely link between the extreme temperature at a specific location and the rise in the average global temperature? One way to pursue an answer for this important question is using extreme value analysis to study the maximal local temperature while including the global mean temperature as a covariate. An issue rising here is that we cannot measure the global mean temperature accurately, and from study of measurement error, this will lead to bias in the parameter estimation. Using the error contaminated covariate has a danger in masking the influence placed on the response by the covariate, this in turn will lead to a susceptible conclusion. To account for the bias bring about by the measurement error of covariate, we proposed two methods here: likelihood method and multiple imputation method.
