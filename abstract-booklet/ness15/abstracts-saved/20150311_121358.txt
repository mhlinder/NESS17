Causal inference based on randomized clinical trials may be compromised when some subjects fail to follow their assigned treatment strategy at some time after the randomization. In this talk, we review Robins' g-formula (1986) as a means of identifying and estimating the causal effect of following different treatment strategies in a randomized trial where treatment switching or any form of noncompliance occurs. Specifically, we review sufficient identifying conditions in a general time-varying setting where (i) measured patient characteristics at a given time are associated with both future outcomes and future treatment and (ii) these characteristics are themselves affected by past treatment. We also review some approaches to effect estimation motivated by these identification results which may be applied in typical high-dimensional settings. These include the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighted estimation.
