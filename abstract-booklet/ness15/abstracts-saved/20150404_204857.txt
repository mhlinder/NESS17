Homophily is defined as the tendency of individuals (nodes) within a social network to form ties with others similar to themselves. This characteristic of social networks can be found among many types of nodal attributes such as age, education, gender, race, marriage, co-membership, work, and socioeconomic status. Differential activity, a characteristic which should not affect the homophily measure, is the ratio of the mean degree (the average number of ties) for all of the nodes containing the attribute of interest to the mean degree of ties for the remaining nodes without that attribute. This project focuses on a form of homophily called the network homophily which has no definitive method to mathematically quantify it. The network homophily is a type of measurement that assigns a homophily value to a subgroup in a network comparing the inter-group ties to the intra-group ties. Using both simulated and real network data, five network homophily metrics were compared under conditions varying in the levels of differential activity and homophily, and in the proportion of nodes possessing the attribute of interest. Many of the metrics were sensitive to changes in at least one if not multiple network characteristics.
