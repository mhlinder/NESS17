The advent of big data in phylogenomics has ushered in conflicting big data results that are each bulwarked by the traditional hallmarks of strong support. Resolution of this conflict requires investigation of the relative power of data to address phylogenetic hypotheses. Publicly available sequenced genes and genomes can provide estimates of relevant parameters such as the rate of evolution of each molecular character, and therefore can provide guidance as to how to optimally design a study. We have derived theory that applies such exogenous data to prioritize gene sequencing and taxon sampling, projecting potential to resolve nodes onto the molecular evolutionary or chronological time scale of interest. It weighs the linear accumulation of signal with internode length, versus both the linear accumulation of bias and the nonlinear accumulation of noise with increasing length of subtending branches of the phylogenetic tree. We have relaxed previous model assumptions of four-taxon trees, deriving theory for all symmetric models of molecular evolution applied to any taxon-sampling scheme.
