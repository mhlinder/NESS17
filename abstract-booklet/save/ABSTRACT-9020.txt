In complex manufacturing and business operations, early warning systems (EWSs) ensure timely detection of unfavorable trends. Such systems can be deployed so that they act as search engines, analyzing available data at time points that are either pre-specified or determined based on process information. A round of analysis typically encompasses a large number of data streams that are governed by an even larger set of statistical parameters. Careful design of monitoring procedures ensures a low rate of false alarms. To ensure efficient utilization of personnel, it is important that these alarms are properly prioritized. We discuss methods and statistics relevant in the process of alarm prioritization, and their use in the field of integrated circuit manufacturing.
