Biomedical data analysis plays a key role in today's medicine. Multivariate current status data is
a common type of Biomedical data which gives rise to two main challenges in data analysis. First,
all event times are censored, making censoring times the only indicator of event occurrence. Second,
an unobserved heterogeneity caused by clusters of units or individuals is probable. To address these
issues, mixed Cox proportional hazard model with random block frailty has been used. Here, we
consider a Bayesian multivariate Gamma-frailty Cox model and augment the likelihood with respect
to random frailties and a set of Poisson latent variables. We also introduce a novel MCMC algorithm
by employing two different cumulative baseline hazard function structures: a transformed mixture
of incomplete Beta distributions and a linear combination of monotone integrated splines. Through
several simulations, we show that our methodology achieves competitive results. We also compare
the performance of the two baseline hazard functions using model selection criteria such as AIC and
DIC. Finally, we apply the model to a bivariate current status cataract dataset and investigate the
effect of various risk factors on the occurrence of cataracts.
