Due to recent technological advancements, high-dimensional data are frequently involved in many areas of science. When an extreme large number of possible predictors are under consideration for the data, marginal likelihood estimation provides an effective way to reduce the high-dimensionality. However, the marginal likelihood-based approach ignores simultaneous influence of predictors and often leads to misidentification of relevant predictors. In this paper, we propose a new variable selection procedure for accounting for the joint influence of important predictors. We use marginal posterior distributions to incorporate all possible predictor effects into the variable selection procedure. Some theoretical properties of the proposed method are investigated. A simulation study demonstrates that our Bayesian approach provides better variable selection performance than existing marginal likelihood methods.
