## Celebrating 30 years of NESS

The Department of Statistics of the University of Connecticut is proud
to host the 31th New England Statistics Symposium on Saturday, April
22, 2017 (http://ness.stat.uconn.edu/). The purpose, as usual, is to
bring together statisticians from all over New England to a central
location to share research, discuss emerging issues in the field, and
network with colleagues. The Symposium local hosts and organizers from
the University of Connecticut are Jun Yan (Chair), Haim Bar, and
Yuping Zhang.

The symposium will feature three [short courses](short-courses), two
invited [plenary talks](keynote-speakers), invited paper sessions, and
posters. There will a student paper competition and a student poster
