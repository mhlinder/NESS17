Professor of Biostatistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison

As a professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical
Informatics and Director of the Biostatistics Shared Resources of the
Carbone Cancer Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dr. Yu
has extensive expertise in clinical biostatistics, risk prediction,
causal inference, and treatment selection. He developed strong
interests in comparative effectiveness research when working with the
General Practice Research Database and The Health Improvement Network
databases to replicate clinical trial results. Following this
work, he is currently the Principal Investigator of a Patient Centered
Outcome Research Institute (PCORI)-funded methodology grant examining
innovative new methods to match medically complex patients to
treatments and interventions.

#### Outline

In the case of substantial heterogeneity of treatment effectiveness, a
key aspect of medical decision making is on matching patients with the
most effective treatments to improve treatment efficacy and adherence,
which in essence is personalizing treatments. Exploratory subgroup
analysis allows the identification of clinically relevant subgroups
from pre-specified variables for such purpose. In this short course,
we will introduce a general framework that encompasses many recent
statistical methods for identifying subgroups of patients who may
benefit from different available treatments. Compared with the
traditional outcome-modeling approaches, these methods focus on
modeling interactions between the treatments and covariates while
by-pass or minimize modeling the main effects of covariates because
the subgroup identification only depends on the sign of the
interaction. Under the proposed framework, we may also estimate the
magnitude of the interaction, which leads to the construction of
scoring system ranking the personalized treatment effect. The proposed
methods are quite flexible and can be used for analysis of both
randomized clinical trials and observational studies.  They also allow
incorporation of regularization in face of high-dimensional data. We
will examine the empirical performance of several procedures belonging
to the proposed framework through extensive numerical studies and real
data analyses. Besides basic concepts and general issues in analysis,
the course will cover active research in modeling multiple and
longitudinal outcomes and in meta-analysis.

#### Prerequisites

The course is accessible to anyone with a knowledge of statistical
inference at the level of introductory graduate level courses in
mathematical statistics and probability. Exposure to causal inference
(based on the potential outcomes), statistical learning theory
(e.g. regularization method) can be helpful, but not is required.
