Spring is a very good time to visit Connecticut---the southernmost
state in the New England area, the third-smallest state by area, and
the fourth-most densely populated of the 50 United States.
Connecticut is also known as the "Constitution State", the "Nutmeg
State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits".
There are many attractions to see and interesting things to do in
Connecticut; see the official webpage of
the [Connecticut Office of Tourism](http://www.ctvisit.com).  The
average local temperature in May has a low of 48.1F and a high of
71.7F.


The nearest airport is Hartford Bradley International Airport (BDL),
which is about 45 minutes by driving to UConn at Storrs, CT.
Transportation to / from Storrs can be
found [here](http://isss.uconn.edu/gettingtouconn/).  If you choose
UConn Airport Shuttle, you need to make your reservation at least one
week in advance.  Alternative transportation options are being
explored.  Fun things going on around campus can be
found
