We call invited session proposals on all aspects of statistics and
probability. Each invited session will have 105 minutes.

The invited session proposal should include the session title, the
session organizer (name, affiliation, email), the session chair, and
4-5 invited speakers (name, affiliation, email, and talk title).

Please submit your proposal to
Prof. [Jun Yan](mailto:jun.yan@uconn.edu) via email as early as
possible.

There will also be a poster session with 3 minute oral presentations.
The oral presentation slides (ppt or pdf) should use the following
format: firstname_lastname.extension should be uploaded online (coming
soon). Poster dimensions are 4' x 4', and the legs add 2 feet.

Reports on work in progress for both invited talks and posters are
welcome.
