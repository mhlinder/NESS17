  "Honest learning for the healthcare system: large-scale evidence
  from real-world data"<br />
  <small>(joint work with Martijn J. Schuemie, Patrick B. Ryan, George
  Hripcsak, and Marc A. Suchard)</small>

    In practice, our learning healthcare system relies primarily on
    observational studies generating one effect estimate at a time using
    customized study designs with unknown operating characteristics and
    publishing -- or not -- one estimate at a time. When we investigate
    the distribution of estimates that this process has produced, we see
    clear evidence of its shortcomings, including an over-abundance of
    estimates where the confidence interval does not include one
    (i.e. statistically significant effects) and strong indicators of
    publication bias. In essence, published observational research
    represents unabashed data fishing. We propose a standardized process
    for performing observational research that can be evaluated,
    calibrated and applied at scale to generate a more reliable and
    complete evidence base than previously possible, fostering a truly
    learning healthcare system. We demonstrate this new paradigm by
    generating evidence about all pairwise comparisons of treatments for
    depression for a relevant set of health outcomes using four large US
    insurance claims databases. In total, we estimate 17,718 hazard
    ratios, each using a comparative effectiveness study design and
    propensity score stratification on par with current state-of-the-art,
    albeit one-off, observational studies. Moreover, the process enables
    us to employ negative and positive controls to evaluate and calibrate
    estimates ensuring, for example, that the 95% confidence interval
    includes the true effect size approximately 95% of time. The result
    set consistently reflects current established knowledge where known,
    and its distribution shows no evidence of the faults of the current
    process. Doctors, regulators, and other medical decision makers can
    potentially improve patient-care by making well-informed decisions
    based on this evidence, and every treatment a patient receives becomes
    the basis for further evidence.

    David Madigan is the Executive Vice-President for Arts & Sciences,
    Dean of the Faculty, and Professor of Statistics at Columbia
    University in the City of New York. He previously served as Chair of the
    Department of Statistics at Columbia University (2008-2013),
    Dean, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Rutgers University (2005-2007),
    Director, Institute of Biostatistics, Rutgers University (2003-2004), and
    Professor, Department of Statistics, Rutgers University (2001-2007).
    He received his bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences 
    (1984, First Class Honours, Gold Medal) and a
    Ph.D. in Statistics (1990), both from Trinity College Dublin.

    Dr. Madigan has over 160 publications in such areas as Bayesian statistics,
    text mining, Monte Carlo methods, pharmacovigilance and probabilistic
    graphical models. In recent years he has focused on statistical
    methodology for generating reliable evidence from large-scale
    healthcare data. From 2011 to 2014 he was a member of the FDA's
    Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.

    Dr. Madigan is a fellow of the American Association of the Advancement
    of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and
    the American Statistical Association (ASA), and an elected member of
    the International Statistical Institute (ISI).  He served as
    Editor-in-Chief of Statistical Science (2008--2010) and Statistical
    Analysis and Data Mining, the ASA Data Science Journal (2013--2015).
