### "Hypothesis Testing for Weak and Sparse Alternatives With Applications to Whole Genome Data"

Massive genetic and genomic data generated using array and sequencing
technology present many exciting opportunities as well as challenges
in data analysis and result interpretation, e.g., how to develop
effective strategies for signal detection using massive genetic and
genomic data when signals are weak and sparse. In this talk, I will
discuss hypothesis testing for sparse alternatives in analysis of
high-dimensional data motivated by gene, pathway/network based
analysis in genome-wide association studies using arrays and
sequencing data. I will focus on signal detection when signals are
weak and sparse, which is the case in genetic and genomic association
studies. I will discuss hypothesis testing for signal detection using
variable selection based penalized likelihood based methods, the
Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC) test, and the Generalized
Berk-Jones test, and the robust omnibus test. I will discuss the
challenges in statistical inference in the presence of both
between-observation correlation and signal sparsity. The results are
illustrated using data from genome-wide association studies and
sequencing studies.

Lin is Chair and Henry Pickering Walcott Professor of Department
of Biostatistics and Coordinating Director of the Program of
Quantitative Genomics at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public
Health, and Professor of Statistics of the Faculty of Art and
Science of Harvard University. Dr. Lin's research interests lie in
development and application of statistical and computational
methods for analysis of massive genetic and genomic,
epidemiological, environmental, and medical data. She currently
works on whole genome sequencing association studies, genes and
environment, analysis of integrated data, and statistical and
computational methods for massive health science data. Dr. Lin
received the 2002 Mortimer Spiegelman Award from the American
Public Health Association and the 2006 COPSS Presidents'
Award. She is an elected fellow of ASA, IMS, and ISI. Dr. Lin
received the MERIT Award (R37) (2007&ndash;2015), and the
Outstanding Investigator Award (OIA) (R35) (2015&ndash;2022) from
the National Cancer Institute. She is the contacting PI of the
Program Project (PO1) on Statistical Informatics in Cancer
Research, the Analysis Center of the Genome Sequencing Program of
the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the T32 training
grant on interdisciplinary training in statistical genetics and
computational biology. Dr. Lin was the former Chair of the COPSS
(2010&ndash;2012) and a former member of the Committee of Applied
and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) of the National Academy of
Science. She is the former Chair of the new ASA Section of
Statistical Genetics and Genomics. She was the former Coordinating
Editor of Biometrics and the founding co-editor of Statistics in
Biosciences, and is currently the Associate Editor of Journal of
the American Statistical Association. She has served on a large
number of statistical society committees, and NIH and NSF review
panels.

### "Honest learning for the healthcare system: large-scale evidence from real-world data"

<small>(joint work with Martijn J. Schuemie, Patrick B. Ryan, George
Hripcsak, and Marc A. Suchard)</small>

In practice, our learning healthcare system relies primarily on
observational studies generating one effect estimate at a time using
customized study designs with unknown operating characteristics and
publishing -- or not -- one estimate at a time. When we investigate
the distribution of estimates that this process has produced, we see
clear evidence of its shortcomings, including an over-abundance of
estimates where the confidence interval does not include one
(i.e. statistically significant effects) and strong indicators of
publication bias. In essence, published observational research
represents unabashed data fishing. We propose a standardized process
for performing observational research that can be evaluated,
calibrated and applied at scale to generate a more reliable and
complete evidence base than previously possible, fostering a truly
learning healthcare system. We demonstrate this new paradigm by
generating evidence about all pairwise comparisons of treatments for
depression for a relevant set of health outcomes using four large US
insurance claims databases. In total, we estimate 17,718 hazard
ratios, each using a comparative effectiveness study design and
propensity score stratification on par with current state-of-the-art,
albeit one-off, observational studies. Moreover, the process enables
us to employ negative and positive controls to evaluate and calibrate
estimates ensuring, for example, that the 95% confidence interval
includes the true effect size approximately 95% of time. The result
set consistently reflects current established knowledge where known,
and its distribution shows no evidence of the faults of the current
process. Doctors, regulators, and other medical decision makers can
potentially improve patient-care by making well-informed decisions
based on this evidence, and every treatment a patient receives becomes
the basis for further evidence.

David Madigan is the Executive Vice-President for Arts & Sciences,
Dean of the Faculty, and Professor of Statistics at Columbia
University in the City of New York. He previously served as Chair of
the Department of Statistics at Columbia University (2008-2013), Dean,
Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Rutgers University (2005-2007),
Director, Institute of Biostatistics, Rutgers University (2003-2004),
and Professor, Department of Statistics, Rutgers University
(2001-2007).  He received his bachelor's degree in Mathematical
Sciences (1984, First Class Honours, Gold Medal) and a Ph.D. in
Statistics (1990), both from Trinity College Dublin.

Dr. Madigan has over 160 publications in such areas as Bayesian statistics,
text mining, Monte Carlo methods, pharmacovigilance and probabilistic
graphical models. In recent years he has focused on statistical
methodology for generating reliable evidence from large-scale
healthcare data. From 2011 to 2014 he was a member of the FDA's
Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.

Dr. Madigan is a fellow of the American Association of the Advancement
of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and
the American Statistical Association (ASA), and an elected member of
the International Statistical Institute (ISI).  He served as
Editor-in-Chief of Statistical Science (2008--2010) and Statistical
Analysis and Data Mining, the ASA Data Science Journal (2013--2015).
